# üß¨ Antibiotic Resistance Prediction using Genomic Unitigs and Machine Learning

This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict **antibiotic resistance** in *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* using **genomic unitig data**. The goal is to identify whether a bacterial strain is **resistant or susceptible** to antibiotics such as **Ciprofloxacin, Azithromycin**, and **Cefixime**.

## üìå Project Objective

To develop and evaluate classification models that:
- Predict antibiotic resistance using DNA unitig features.
- Handle imbalanced genomic datasets.
- Provide interpretable insights into resistance-linked sequences.
- Align with public health goals (SDG 3 - Good Health & Wellbeing).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn** (SVC, Random Forest, GridSearchCV, K-Fold)
- **CatBoost, XGBoost**
- **Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE, SMOTENC)**
- **Plotly (for visualization)**
- **BioPython** (for DNA sequence analysis)
